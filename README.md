### Problem Statement: You own the mall and want to understand the customers like who can be easily converge Target Customers so that the sense can be given to marketing team and plan the strategy accordingly.

## Inspiration 
1. How to achieve customer segmentation using machine learning algorithm (KMeans Clustering) in Python in simplest way.
2. Who are your target customers with whom you can start marketing strategy easy to converse
3. How the marketing strategy works in real world

## ML Model 
K-means clustering is a widely used and straightforward unsupervised machine learning algorithm.

In unsupervised learning, algorithms draw inferences from datasets based solely on input features, without relying on labeled outcomes or predefined categories.

A cluster is a group of data points that are grouped together because they share similar characteristics or patterns. The goal of clustering is to organize data into clusters such that data points within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.

## Customer segments based on the 5 clusters
* Cluster 1: Customers with medium annual income and medium annual spend.
These customers have a balanced income and spending pattern, suggesting they may be in a stable financial position and likely represent the general customer base.

* Cluster 2: Customers with high annual income and high annual spend.
These customers are likely high-value individuals with substantial disposable income. They may be inclined to spend more on premium products and services.

* Cluster 3: Customers with low annual income and low annual spend.
This segment likely represents budget-conscious customers with limited spending ability. They may be looking for more affordable options and discounts.

* Cluster 4: Customers with high annual income but low annual spend.
These customers have substantial income but tend to spend less. They could be more conservative in their purchasing behavior, possibly focusing on savings or specific high-value items.

* Cluster 5: Customers with low annual income but high annual spend.
These customers may prioritize spending despite their lower income, indicating they could be more impulsive or prioritize certain categories of spending (e.g., entertainment, lifestyle).
